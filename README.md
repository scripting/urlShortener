# urlShortener

A JavaScript URL shortener running in Node.js. 

### How to set up

Download the folder and open <a href="https://github.com/scripting/urlShortener/blob/master/config.json">config.json</a> in a text editor.

You can specify the port, the domain you're serving and the path to the create-short-url function.

1. <i>myPort</i> should be 80 if the app is running on its own server. If it's running behind another server you might want to use another port.

2. <i>rootDomain</i> is the domain you're allocating URLs from. My domain is pocalyp.se. Your domain will obviously be something else. It must point to this server via DNS using a wildcard so that all sub-domains also point to this server. 

3. <i>createPath</i> is like a password, so it should be something fairly random. If you leave it at its default value anyone who knows your domain will be able to allocate URLs. Maybe this is what you want? If so, leave it as-is. 

config.json is also where we store all the data for the server, including the URL mappings, and hit counts, etc. 

Open the file in a text editor after launching the server to see the values it initializes. And you can watch it as it the app is running through the /status endpoint.

### Updates

#### v0.5.2 7/15/20 by DW

Rebuilt the app using davehttp and daveutils, and deployed under PagePark. 

Lots of little changes and simplifications. The development environment has improved a lot in 4.5 years. ;-)

#### v0.42 12/19/15 by DW

We maintain a folder of static files, arranged by domain, one for each URL. 

The files contain the HTML needed to convert the shortener to a static site. You can drop those folders into the <i>domains</i> folder of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagepark">PagePark</a>, for example, and point the root domain at the server, it will serve the files. 

I added this feature because eventually all servers go away, and when this one does, I want to be able to easily keep the links from breaking. 

#### v0.41 12/16/15 by DW

The home page of each sub-domain is now a JSON listing of all the items posted on that domain.
